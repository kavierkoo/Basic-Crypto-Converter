Basic Crypto Converter is a simple program scripted with Python 2.6.11.

30-Jul-2016:
	The program currently allows to convert several Crypto including:
		- Hex to ASCHII
		- Base64 Encode/Decode
		- Hash (MD5,SHA1,SHA224,SHA256,SHA384,SHA512)

More crypto will be add once I have time. The program is designed by Kavier Koo as I am too lazy to look for online converter whenever I need one.
